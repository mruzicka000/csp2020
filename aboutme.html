  <p class="third">Hi, I'm Mark. I am 17 and currently a senior at Shorewood Highschool.</p>
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>I love riding my bike. For the past 2 years I have finished 3rd overall on my NICA series.
  I also love playing video games and hanging out with my friends</p>
  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p> I really am not that picky, unless it's contry, which I can't stand. My favorites though are definitely is R&B, ALT, and POP.</p>
  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>Well, this year is interesting to say the least. My goals have chanced a lot since the begining of the year. I was going to try to podium in varsity, but all my races have been canceled.
  School wise though I'm still not totally sure what to expect, but I want to try to enjoy my senior year as much as possible.</p>
